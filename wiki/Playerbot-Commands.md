Playerbots are programmed to respond to chat commands. The Multibot and Unbot addons are designed to handle most of the common chat commands for the player, but you may still have need for manual chat commands as you play. It is important to distinguish between "Altbots" and "Rndbots": Altbots are manually player-created bots on a normal account, whereas "Rndbots" and their accounts are automatically generated based on .conf settings. Rndbots will automatically gear themselves, apply talents, and roam the world whereas Altbots will not.

## Altbot Setup Commands
Altbots are characters that you create on your account (or others) first, and then get assigned bot control via the commands below.

command | action
:---|:---
``.playerbots bot add [name1,name2,name3]`` | login altbots. Note that you are also able to login altbots from other accounts depending on your configurations.
``.playerbots bot addaccount [accountname]`` | login an entire account of altbots. Depending on your configurations you can login other accounts.
``.playerbots bot remove name1,name2,name3`` | logout altbots
``.playerbots bot add *`` |  login all altbots
``.playerbots bot remove *`` | logout all altbots
``maintenance`` | enable altbot to learn all available spells and skills, supplement consumables, enchant gear, and repair. Can also be used on rndbots, but they automatically do this. Whisper for an individual bot or use /p or /r to simultaneously target multiple bots.
``autogear`` | automatically gear your altbot, with quality based on your .conf settings AutoGearQualityLimit and AutoGearScoreLimit. Can also be used on rndbots, but they automatically do their own gear initilization upon level up.
``talents`` | check current spec of bot
``talents spec list`` | check specs available for the class
``talents spec [spec name]`` | force bot to change their talents to the chosen spec, see the .conf for list of spec names or whisper your bot "talents spec list"
``talents apply <link>`` | apply talents link to bot
``glyphs`` | lists the botâ€™s currently equipped glyphs in the client locale, using item links for proper translations
``glyph equip [GlyphID1 GlyphID2 GlyphID3 GlyphID4 GlyphID5 GlyphID6]`` | bot applies given glyphs
``reset botAI`` | reset bot settings
``reset`` | reset current bot actions like casting spell, moving etc.

## AddClass Setup Command
AddClass bots utilize unused Rndbots in your system. They are currently recommended only to be used for testing purposes i.e. quickly forming a raid group to test certain bots in a given raid, whereas Altbots are strongly recommended for long-term progression playthroughs.

command | action
:---|:---
``.playerbots bot addclass [className]`` | summon a new Rndbot of the desired class (note: death knight syntax is dk, otherwise the rest are standard)

## Party/Raid General Commands

command | action
:---|:---
``summon`` | summon bot to you (see .conf for different options to configure this command)
``release`` | release spirit when dead
``revive`` | revive when near a spirit healer
``leave`` | leave party
``attack`` | attack selected target
``follow`` | run toward player (/w for individual or /p or /r for party/raid)
``flee`` | run toward player ignoring everything else (/w for individual or /p or /r for party/raid)
``stay`` | stay in place
``runaway`` | kite mob
``grind`` | attack anything
``disperse set x`` | force bots to maintain a distance of x yards from each other
``disperse disable`` | resets disperse distance to default value
``give leader`` | if bot is party/raid leader it will pass it to their master

Furthermore, you can specify by group or type for some commands like "attack" and "follow", such as:
- "@group1 follow"
- "@group2 attack"
- "@tank follow"
- "@ranged attack"
- "@rangeddps attack"
- "@meleedps attack"

You can also command multiple groups at a time like below:
- "@Group1,4"
- "@group2-5,8"

## Playerbot Spell Commands

command | action
:---|:---
``spells`` | show bot's spells
``cast [spell_name]`` | /w a bot to cast a spell
``cast [spell_name] on [PlayerName]`` | /w a bot to cast a spell on a specified Player
``ss +[spell id]`` | add spell to ignored spells list
``ss -[spell id]`` | remove spell from ignored spells list
``trainer`` | show what bot can learn from the selected trainer
``trainer learn`` | learn from the selected trainer

## Party/Raid Target Selection

:---|:---
``rti <icon>`` | sets the target icon for the bot to prioritize (icons: skull, cross, circle, star, square, triangle, diamond, and moon)
``attack rti target`` | commands bots to attack their rti target
``<name/group> rtsc toggle`` | toggles the ability to point and click with mouse button to save a location for specified bots to move to, can specify by group or class (ie "@druid rtsc toggle" or "@group1 rtsc toggle")
``rtsc go save`` | command bots to move back into saved rtsc position
``rtsc cancel`` | cancel rtsc toggle
``rti cc <icon>`` | sets a specific icon as the cc target (the default is moon)

## Strategies

The bots are programmed to respond to triggers by listing possible actions and choosing one based on a strategy. Bots use two categories of strategies: combat and non-combat.  You can add, subtract, or toggle strategies using the combat (co) and non-combat (nc) prefixes in your commands:

```
co +strategy1,-strategy2,~strategy3
nc +strategy1,-strategy2,~strategy3
```

You can query the bot to report what strategies are currently being used:

```
co ?
nc ?
```

### Combat Strategies

strategy | description
:---|:---|
``tank`` | use threat-generating abilities (warrior, paladin, druid will use ``bear``)
``tank assist`` | make tank pull mobs off of others
``dps`` |  use dps abilities (rogue, hunter, shaman, priest, druid will use ``cat``)
``cc`` |  use cc abilities (requires cc rti target, default is moon icon; it is useful to know that bots will not attack rti target and will not try to use cc if target is not stunnable)
``caster`` | wasn't in docs but is in game
``assist`` | target one mob at a time
``aoe`` | target many mobs at a time
``boost`` | bots will use big cds (useful to use -boost and +boost on macros to control when to burst on bosses)
``threat`` | dps will actively avoid grabbing threat (useful for bosses that wipe aggro or if tanks are struggling to hold aggro)
``grind`` | attack any visible target, then switch to another one and so on.
``heal`` | focus on party healing (shaman, priest, druid, paladin)
``focus`` | stop casting aoe spell or debuff spells on multiple attackers (focus on the single target)
``avoid aoe`` | automatically avoid the majority of harmful aoe spells
``save mana`` | healers save mana by prioritizing high-efficiency spells when mana falls below a threshold
``healer dps`` | healers cast damage spells if they have enough mana
``tank face`` | ensure the current target does not face ranged players in the group (to counter breath and cleave-like spells)
``behind`` | move to the target's back (rear flank) when they are not positioned behind the target

## Account linking for Altbot control

As an alternative to controlling the characters from your own account or guild member accounts, this allows to link up different accounts together to allow control of the characters as Altbots. This is based on the ``AiPlayerbot.AllowTrustedAccountBots = 1`` option in the playerbots config file.

command | action
:---|:---
``.playerbots account setKey somePlayerDefinedSecurityKeyValue`` | Define a securityKey for the current account (the key will be overridden when defined multiple times)
``.playerbots account link ACCOUNTNAME somePlayerDefinedSecurityKeyValue`` | Link an account by using its securityKey
``.playerbots account linkedAccounts`` | Shows a list of accounts, which are currently linked with this account
``.playerbots account unlink ACCOUNTNAME`` | Remove a linked account (this will remove the link for both sides, ensuring that access to the characters can be canceled from both sides anytime)

## Miscellaneous Commands

command | action
:---|:---
``los`` | list game objects, items, creatures and npcs the bot can see
``stats`` | show stat summary (inventory, gold, xp, etc.)
``home`` | set home at the selected innkeeper
``playerbot bot initself`` | CAREFUL WITH THIS - re-rolls YOUR character
``playerbot bot list`` | lists your altbots (and your other characters you can add as bots if you have that enabled, but I'd be very careful if you do that as you can then re-roll your other characters using the init command)
``playerbot bot tweak`` | sets the tweakvalue (seems to be related to a config value that's no longer present and the variable it changes doesn't seem to actually do anything anymore)
``playerbot bot self`` | make yourself into a bot, you have to logout to turn this off, dont run it twice without doing so (it wont toggle it back off like its supposed to, it actually seems to apply multiple AI's onto yourself all fighting to do different things, sounds fun until it crashes the server)
``playerbot bot lookup`` | doesn't do anything but print out a useless usage message (which says you're supposed to give it a class parameter but doing so doesn't change anything because the function called is literally *just* the usage message there's no functionality there)
``.playerbots bot init=rare name1,name2,name3`` | respawn bot at your level with talents & rare gear (gearing currently bugged, recommend autogear instead)
``who`` | show bot race, spec, talents, class, level, average item level, current zone 
``who [profession name]`` | show bot profession skill level

## Overrides

You can override everything and instruct the bot to do something specific:

command | description
:---|:---|
``do attack`` | attack target
``do loot`` | loot target
``do attack my target`` | attack my target
``do add all loot`` | check every corpse and game object for loot

## Example Macros

To make bots flee with you from the danger:

```
/p reset

/p co +passive
/p do follow
```

To make bots follow you and assist you in attack:

```

/p co -passive
/p do follow
```

To make bots stay in place and assist you in attack:

```
/p nc -follow,+stay,+passive
/p co +passive
/p do stay
```

## Help

The bot can tell you all available commands it will accept:

```
/w help
```
